                                            Treatment for brain meningiomas typically involves surgical removal of the
                                            tumor. However, surgery in areas near the brain carries significant risks,
                                            including potential nerve damage, brain tissue injury, or further
                                            neurological impairment. Other treatment options may include radiation
                                            therapy, but this varies depending on the size and aggressiveness of the
                                            tumor.
